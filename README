Analysis from Part 2 - 

- There are 12 months on Mars.
- There are 1,867 days of data.
- Month 3 has the lowest average temperature, and month 8 has the highest. I'm not sure if month 3 corresponds to March and if month 8 corresponds to August so I'm sticking with calling them months 3 and 8.
- Month 6 had the lowest average atmospheric pressure and month 9 has the highest.
- Based on the daily minimum temperatures graph spanning 1,867 days, looking at peak to peak lowest average temp, i see a span from about day 500 to about day 1250, likewise highest average peak to peak somewhere 
around 800 to about 1450. Minimum to minimum visual estimated difference is 750, maximum to maximum visual estimate difference is 650. Averaging this out, I think a Martian year is about 700 days. 
I Googled it and a Mars year is 687 Earth day, so this estimate is close, within 25%.
